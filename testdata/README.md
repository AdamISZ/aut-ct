TEST DATA
=======

This is a holding area for various keysets for testing. More will be added, probably building out a set of test vectors for the proofs.

There is a large set of 48000 (approx) public keys derived from signet, taproot outputs, generated from the range of blocks indicated.

The two other keysets are generated from private keys corresponding to integers 1,2,3... with the maximum being one less than the digit shown. So for example the private key of the first public key is 010101..01 (32 single bytes of '1'). So an example proof invocation would be `./autct 0303...03 fakekeys-6.txt`.
